I want to design a program that works with ESRI’s ArcGIS. I am hoping that it will take two ArcGIS shapefiles as inputs, one consisting of points representing archaeological sites, and the other a polygon representing the geographical distribution of a mineral resource deposit. The program will identify which of the points fall within the polygon and then create a new point shapefile as an output representing the archaeological sites that overlap with the natural resource polygon. I would also like the program to output a CSV file with the information from the attribute table linked to the archaeological sites in the new shapefile output.

This proposed project will directly help me with my larger master’s thesis project. For my thesis, I am comparing the geographical distributions of archaeological sites and valuable mineral resources in Afghanistan to help predict which sites are at risk of being damaged by modern large-scale mining projects in the future. Recent work conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey in Afghanistan, in conjunction with the Afghan government, has identified a wealth of mineral resources that the Afghan government hopes can be mined, thus generating huge amounts of revenue for the country. However, these mining projects pose a very real threat to Afghanistan’s extant cultural heritage. I am hoping to identify which sites are at the highest risk of damage or destruction to aid in future policy decisions.

I am planning to work with the Python interface of arcGIS to design this project. Because of the inputs that I will specify, any two shapefiles could be inputted into this program, thus fulfilling the interactivity requirement. ArcGIS has a component called Model Builder which allows you to ‘build’ simple, automated sequences within ArcGIS. I will most likely use Model Builder to explore the best way to structure my program within ArcGIS, and then work directly with the Python terminal in ArcGIS to implement my code.
